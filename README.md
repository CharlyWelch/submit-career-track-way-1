Student work for Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, OR


Developer: Charly Welch

## How to Get Started:

Each of the four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) takes two numerical arguments, and will return a numerical solution. 

## How to Use API:

The functions are exported from calc.js, which can be imported and functions can be called by `calc.add(a, b)`, for example.
